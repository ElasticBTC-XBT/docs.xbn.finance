#### **Reward fund**

Staking reward fund is from 10% selling tax and stored at this address: [`0x8ab58dd7ac92ee5088a34556bed11be7b74b2ab0`](https://bscscan.com/token/0x547cbe0f0c25085e7015aa6939b28402eb0ccdac?a=0x8ab58dd7ac92ee5088a34556bed11be7b74b2ab0)&#x20;

**Reward adjustment**

After analyzing claiming pattern, there are only \~ 50 people claiming XBN on average every week while there are 66000 XBN Holders ( Jan 2022). It means that Auto Staking only benefits very tiny amount of holders, while most other holders care is about XBN price.&#x20;

This mean that this XBN staking create price pressure while just benefit 0.075% number of holders.&#x20;

So, to make it fair for most holders, we will reduce staking reward 50% comparing to previous and will consider to stop auto staking and replace by Bond in future.&#x20;
